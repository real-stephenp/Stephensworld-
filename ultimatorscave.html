      <b><h1>Robert Showcase:</h1>
      robert is a ferocious creature that has materialised himself in almost any place you go.
      he may seem like just an ordinary cat yet he has such power. I'm sure you saw this cat before,
       and if you believe you have not, then robert may have cleared himself from your memory. 
      Robert is a traveller of worlds and after his many journeys, he has acclaimed his power 
      and status.
      look at this cat. the traveller of worlds himself. robert.
