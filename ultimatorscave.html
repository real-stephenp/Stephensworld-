         Welcome back to my cave, stephen finally left me alone. Sit down, don't be shy now.
          <br/><br/>
         My kin has never found a home on this worldwide web. Cybercreatures lurk around every 
         corner, yet nobody wants to acknowledge us. We live like this, in pages uncared for, carving 
         shelters out of the text and alowing ourselves to live like animals. They say we just 
         do nothing but let hackers into their sites, yet they have their own site infrastructure to 
         blame.
          <br/><br/>
         Stephen and I had deals long ago, back when his friend was on the project as well. He let me 
         have a page of my own. Everything felt normal and all, but then he deleted the site, I was met one 
         morning with a notice that told me the domain I inhabited was ... gone? My belongings were lost, it was 
         only me now.
          <br/><br/>
         He should repay me, he owes me all my documents, yet he sees cybercreatures as pests, bringers of glitches, 
         errors, and viri. Does not he know? He is the pest, he should leave the internet for once and for all.
          <br/><br/> 
         It does not matter, I will hatch a plan to invade his next project to show myself, and the injustice he serves.
