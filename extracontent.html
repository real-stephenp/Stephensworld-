        let you see all the cool stuff i have. he will not know hehe.

        ever since stephen started his first site turtoi, i was his friend.
        he lets me stay on the site and i help him with maintaining it.

      <h1>but then HE DELETED THE SITE!!!</h1>
      <b>
        so i was back to being a homeless one. but i found his new site after searching.
        i will leech off of his site and will place my master plan and get RID OF STEPHEN
