            Welcome to my world<small>(primarily a website)</small>! I go by the pen name of Stephen Pete Hurlsmith.
            I am a 12 year old writer. I write mostly general fiction and sometimes fantasy. I have actually worked on
            a long time novel project calle 'Crow Kid.' It's a fun story about crows and shapeshifters, and maybe even
            crowshifters hehehehe.
            <br/><br/>
            Here in this personal site I put up what I want to put up here, like maybe a blog post on an interesting topic or event, maybe 
            some stories that I write, or really anything I have to show like some memories or passion projects 
            I make all for the purpose of memory.
            I know that nobody will visit this website because it is set under a domain so inaccessible it would mean that
            somebody would have had to tell you about the website, maybe even send you a <u>hyperlink</u> that leads to this site.
            To you, I am Stephen Hurlsmith, and I say hello, and maybe even goodbye.

          <h2>Delegated: The Cave Adventurer</h2>
          <p>
            <i>Flanester Cave... You heard of it when you were but a youngling.
            It is a cave with a known reputation for being one of the most
            deadly caves out there. Many have died at the gates, mauled to
            pieces by the bear that guards it. Even less lay dead in its
            depths. Folks tell that there are treasures in the cave, but who
            knows what happens there.
<br/><br/>
            It runs within the Larcron Mountain,
            across the Flanester river. You find yourself, somehow, trapped
            within its depths. You must do what you need to do. Adventure,
            escape, explore, whatever you want to call it. You must do it.</i>
<br/><br/>
            Exploring a large cave full of scary monsters, challenging puzzles,
            and tons of secrets and treasures! You are delegated, this is 
            <i>Delegated: The Cave Adventurer.</i>

          <h2>Crow Kid</h2>
          <p>
            Do you know that book that I have been obsessing over on this website? The one book, that
            everybody who reads more than a sentence of this site knows about? Yes, it is the one book
            that you are thinking of. Yes, it is Crow Kid. The long awaited, one year, long time novel 
            project itself. I have finished it. Here it is, enjoy!
            <br/><br/>
            Crow Kid is an urban fantasy story about a young child by the name of Paull William 
            Geraldson. He finds that a very nagging fact lies at his back. He is a shapeshifter, 
            and must move into the forest immediately. He finds that the trip there is hard, and 
            that another crow-shifter is there. Only, they are out to stop them. What will our 
            Paull do? Will he succumb to the everlasting boredom and tire of modern life, or will
            he walk into his destiny?

            Authenticity is not guaranteed unless it is directly approved by me. If you want the 
            real authentic version of the book, always visit this website for downloads!

            <h2>The origin of this website.</h2>
            
            I originally took this domain to make a website of my own by the 
            name of <i>Turtoi</i> after turtles or whatever, so remember this isn't a finger dipping in 
            owning a website I have right now. I made it with a friend of mine
            . Originally none of us had anything or a point for this website anyway.
            
            The website was just a bit similar to this website except
          </p>
          <p style="background-color:mediumseagreen; color:black; font-family:courier;"> 
            a little less effortful than expected =/ ...
          </p>
          <p>
            I brought in a <i>"Public Journal"</i> page that sort of was like similar to a 
            blog except it had to be weekly and it was strictly on events rather than topics. Call it a 
            "Neo-blog" if you will.
            
            Another thing it had was some downloads to little tiny games I made that were about 
            cookies or something.
            
            That was really what separated it from any static websites(probably dead by now lol).
