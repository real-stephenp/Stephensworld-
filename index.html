        <h2>Who I am and what this is</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to my world! I go by the pen name of Stephen Hurlsmith. I am an 11 year old
            aspiring writer who is currently working on an urban fantasy novel about shapeshifters
            and crows and such. I like to read sci-fi and fantasy novels. They're all very interesting but I have yet to read
            anything much.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Here I put up what I want to put up here, like maybe a blog post on an interesting topic or event, maybe 
            some stories that I write, or really anything I have to show like some memories or passion projects 
            I make all for the purpose of memory.
            I know that nobody will visit this website because it is set under a domain so inaccessible it would mean that
            somebody would have had to tell you about the website send you a <u>hyperlink</u> that leads to this site.

            <h2>The origin of this website.</h2>
            
            I originally took this domain to make a website of my own by the 
            name of <i>Turtoi</i> after turtles or whatever, so remember this isn't a finger dipping in 
            owning a website I have right now. I made it with a friend of mine
            . Originally none of us had anything or a point for this website anyway.
            
            The website was just a bit similar to this website except
