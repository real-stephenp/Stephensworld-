          Welcome to my world! I go by the pen name of  Stephen Hurlsmith. I am an 11 year old
          aspiring writer who is currently working on an urban fantasy novel about shapeshifters
          and crows and such. 
          <br/>
          Here I put up what I want to put up here like some basic information about me and so and so.
          I know that nobody will visit this website because it is set under a domain so inaccessible it would mean that
          somebody would have had to send you a <u>hyperlink<u/> that leads to this site.
          <br/>
          I originally took this domain to make a website of my own by the 
          name of <i>Turtoi</i> after turtles or whatever. I made it with a friend of mine who I 
          will leave anonymous. Originally none of us had anything or a point to post. And since I
          was the brain side of the whole site. I basically made his side of the website as inaccessible
          as possible.
