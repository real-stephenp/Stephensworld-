            Welcome to my world<small>(primarily a website)</small>! I go by the pen name of Stephen Pete Hurlsmith.
            I am a young aspiring writer who is currently working on a fantasy novel about shapeshifters
            and crows and such things.
            <br/><br/>
            Here I put up what I want to put up here, like maybe a blog post on an interesting topic or event, maybe 
            some stories that I write, or really anything I have to show like some memories or passion projects 
            I make all for the purpose of memory.
            I know that nobody will visit this website because it is set under a domain so inaccessible it would mean that
            somebody would have had to tell you about the website, maybe even send you a <u>hyperlink</u> that leads to this site.
            To you, I am Stephen Hurlsmith, and I say hello, and maybe even goodbye. 
          </p>

            <h2>The origin of this website.</h2>
            
            I originally took this domain to make a website of my own by the 
            name of <i>Turtoi</i> after turtles or whatever, so remember this isn't a finger dipping in 
            owning a website I have right now. I made it with a friend of mine
            . Originally none of us had anything or a point for this website anyway.
            
            The website was just a bit similar to this website except
          </p>
          <p style="background-color:mediumseagreen; color:black; font-family:courier;"> 
            a little less effortful than expected =/ ...
          </p>
          <p>
            I brought in a <i>"Public Journal"</i> page that sort of was like similar to a 
            blog except it had to be weekly and it was strictly on events rather than topics. Call it a 
            "Neo-blog" if you will.
            
            Another thing it had was some downloads to little tiny games I made that were about 
            cookies or something.
            
            That was really what separated it from any static websites(probably dead by now lol).
          </p>

            Welp, whatever it is. It's nice to see you have read about me and it's nice to see you.
            Visit soon maybe, there'll always be something for new for store.
