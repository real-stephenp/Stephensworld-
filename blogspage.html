        <h3 style="color:blue;">Snow reaching! Yippee or Oh no? <address style="color:black;">18/1/2022</address></h3>
        <p>
          A few days ago snow started to lighten up the whole place. It's a real refreshment
          from the annual blaze of sun so hot it would tan anyone that stood under it for more than 30
          SECONDS.
          <br/> <br/>
          At first the snow was as regular as anything really. Me and my brothers got to wrap ourselves up and build
          a crude sowman out of chunks of snow we found scattered across our neighborhood. It's more of a low budget 
          column than a real snowman with details but thst really doesn't matter. Not to mention I literally could not
          feel my hands after I went out! Real problem honestly, but the laws of the universe will always freeze my 
          fingers off when it snows so it's better not to complain.
          <br/><br/>

          <br/><br/>
          The next day I woke up to realising that the whole thing had collapsed down overnight! But that's not the point, 
          the snow actually started to gather up and solidify. So it became snow but with the texture of a fragile rock. That's 
          really weird but I'll have to check it out for myself sometime.
          <br/><br/>
          Today the whole thing gets more and more strong, the air started to get midly harder to breathe in, as in fog takes up a good 
          chunk of the breathed air so it's like inhaling water but with a bit of air. Fog became so strong it could turn you blind.
          Whatever it is, news predicts this unnatural cold will go on until the 25th! =O That's like alot of time for if you live where I live.
          But luckily I got a break from school which really did help alot! They owe me a break after what I did.
          That's all I really have to say for today really.
