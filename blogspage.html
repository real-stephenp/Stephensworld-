        <h3>My philosophy of life and death. <address>8/2/2022</address></h3>
        <p>
          Hello, steffy back! Sorry I didn't get to upload something meaninful in a long time but surely now this could suffice.
          <br/><br/>
          Recently I've been reading <i>Skellig, by David Almond.</i> Yes yes, say whatever, it's a childrens book, but 
          I do know that it was a good read. Very good indeed! The book talked of a man left in a dirty garage to a kid with 
          a struggling baby sister, and so the kid and his neighbor go together to save the man, and he gives them wings and disappears.
          <br/><br/>
          It's given me some thoughts on where the man himself went, which leads me to think really much about life and death.
          This brings me to my newfound philosophy, other than the old one, which relied on just thinking there's life after death.
          <br/><br/>
          I believe that life is a cycle, one not much are usual with, but still a cycle. You are born and you die, and from there, a 
          worry shouldn't come up for you are already dead. This is a knob-ended cycle, but it branches to make new and beautiful lives. This knowledge 
          that past death, you can do absolutely <b><i>nothing</i></b> 
          brings more meaning to your life. Once you know that what can be done can only be done <b><i>now, </i></b> with no buts
          and if and maybes', that is where you truly live life to the fullest of enjoyment and peace.
          <br/><br/>
          One also can't just <i>know</i> that, they must also be content and <i>accept</i> that fact.
          <br/><br/>
          After death, you are not remembered. What you do is remembered. If you do not do something, your name will be wiped off the face 
          of the earth. If somebody wants their name to be remembered, they must do something important, something people can remember them by.
          I'm not saying you have to do it, it's just if you want to be remembered. If you'd like that, do something you wanted to do and one 
          that people can know you by.
          <br/><br/>
          A favourite quote of mine is the following one that puts this into short words.
          <br/>
          <p style="text-align:center;"><i>"Some live to eat, and others eat to live." <b> <br/> --Confucius</b></i></p>
          <br/>
          The ones who "live to eat" think life is all about survival, and do not care for the actual contentment of living. Those who eat to 
          live know what life actually is, an experience of great and awful things and not a period of time in between you are locked in a body 
          of meat and bones.
          
          That, my friends, concludes my blog today. I hope you ejoyed reading this. Real life issues like homework are in thw way, so I'll see you and 
          remember that to you I say hello, and maybe even goodbye.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color:green;">Got a cool idea for a story, whaddayathink? <address style="color:black;">31/1/2022<address></h3>
        <p>
          So I've recently got this idea for a whole story about squirrels and ravens fighting for a forest. Decided 
          I could write up something along the lines of that. If you've got a thought on this, I could flesh the idea out.
          <br/><br/>
          The story here starts out with the setting. There are two islands, the good guys island and the bad guys island. The 
          forest is the one with the larger area, is on the good guys island, and it has been fully inhabited 
          by all types of animals, nice and exotic types aswell. This one is basically never visited to by a human.
          <br/>
          The other one, is the wasted land, is located on the bad guys island, and is wasted out by humans but one thing we 
          know is that the ravens and sparrows live there. Only that, and then the entire climax happens.
          <br/><br/>
          One day a raven sets out to visit the world beyond their deaded out island(its about time they did). When this raven 
          comes back he tells them of the land and they soon over time build a relationship with them. But the sparrows and ravens 
          decide to take out the land for themselves,(dumb idea, youll see why) and start a war with them.
          <br/><br/>
          The war goes on and on and on, until the final battle where they are about to kill out the king of that forest land. And 
          then from there we lose the forest years after but in the end something happens.
          <br/><br/>
          The crows lose out their land and after all that squabbling and ribaldry they realise they doomed themselves.
          <br/><br/>
          This represents the idea of what ignorance and despair brings you, even more problems if not tackled well. I think this story 
          can teach that you should always think about what you do before doing it. That you shouldn't make impulsive decisions.
          Anyways, thanks for tuning in on this little thought blog. To you I am Stephen P. Hurlsmith, and I say hello, and maybe even 
          goodbye.

        <h3>Did some more research on snow solidifying. <address>25/1/2022<address></h3>
        <p>
          As the snowstorm week reaches its halt and spring arrives, I got some info on what was going on.
          <br/><br/>
          Turns out, that solid fragile rock-like snow is called <i>heavy snow,</i> and it usually is defined
          as "snow that piles up to 2.032 decimeters in a day or less." And this snow was sure heavy. I'd 
          estimate around 1 decimeter on the first few days and 3 decimeters by the climax of this snow storm lasting a week.
          <br/><br/>
          Not to mention that the temperatures would go up to -15 degrees centigrade at the maximum. So this sure 
          was cold.
          <br/><br/>
          The events of the snow storm were a bit <i>limiting.</i> Our water supply froze, so for 4 days we had to 
          use bottled up water in tanks and our dishes and utensils piled up. Only today, as of writing, 
          has the water melted and reached our sink. To make matters even worse, for a short period of time between 
          friday and sunday our kerosene heater didn't work out. In Saturday, I tried playing out in the snow but 
          it was so cold outside that I couldnt feel my hand for 10 minutes and after, it became tiring to hold a pencil.
          <br/><br/>
          But all is well and fine now, the sun is reaching out and the snow is melting out now so there are no worries.
          Though, this reminds me that there was an event a little similar to this<sup>(though more extreme)</sup> that 
          I could be talking about. The 1972 Iran Blizzard. Well, see you next tuesday, I'll probably be talking about it.
        </p>
        <hr/><hr/>
        <h3 style="color:blue;">Snow reaching! Yippee or Oh no? <address style="color:black;">18/1/2022</address></h3>
        <p>
          A few days ago snow started to lighten up the whole place. It's a real refreshment
          from the annual blaze of sun so hot it would tan anyone that stood under it for more than 30
          SECONDS.
          <br/> <br/>
          At first the snow was as regular as anything really. Me and my brothers got to wrap ourselves up and build
          a crude sowman out of chunks of snow we found scattered across our neighborhood. It's more of a low budget 
          column than a real snowman with details but thst really doesn't matter. Not to mention I literally could not
          feel my hands after I went out! Real problem honestly, but the laws of the universe will always freeze my 
          fingers off when it snows so it's better not to complain.
          <br/><br/> 
          <img src="siteimages/snowpic1912022.jpg" alt="An image of me and my brothers was supposed to be here :(" height="503" width="525" border="6">
          <br/><i><small>An image of me and my brother from Sunday.(I'm the taller one hehe)</small></i>
          <br/><br/>
          The next day I woke up to realising that the whole thing had collapsed down overnight! But that's not the point, 
          the snow actually started to gather up and solidify. So it became snow but with the texture of a fragile rock. That's 
          really weird but I'll have to check it out for myself sometime.
          <br/><br/>
          Today the whole thing gets more and more strong, the air started to get midly harder to breathe in, as in fog takes up a good 
          chunk of the breathed air so it's like inhaling water but with a bit of air. Fog became so strong it could turn you blind.
          Whatever it is, news predicts this unnatural cold will go on until the 25th! =O That's like alot of time for if you live where I live.
          But luckily I got a break from school which really did help alot! They owe me a break after what I did.
          That's all I really have to say for today really.
