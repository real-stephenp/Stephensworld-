        <h3>The missed call. January of 2022</h3>
        <p>
          He walked through the spiraling staircases and long hallways that engulfed them. The never ending search for an escape seemed almost eternal. He did not know when he started searching, or how he got there, or how he would get out, or even who he was. All he knew was to keep searching until he found an escape from the repeating floors.<br/><br/> Each floor had a long hallway going infinitely wide. Running up and down the floors, he couldn’t find anything. He would occasionally find a rock or a twig, but what use would a rock or a twig be anyway. Running infinitely towards any side wouldn't help anyway as they all were the same.<br/><br/> He got up from the ground and started running back to where the stairs where he came from. He neared the stairs step by step. His heartbeat and breath could be heard from miles away. As he walked, he noticed a few burns on the beige carpet.

<br/><br/>He looked away at the continuing hallway that went only one direction, and never anywhere else. The thought of him walking for an eternity seemed boring to them, and so he walked back to the staircase. As he climbed up, a sign reading, "LAST FLOOR"  appeared. He looked away from the sign to see a brown door towards the unknown. The door opened up and a shining light flew through. He walked to the light curiously, now realising there was finally an escape.<br/><br/>

Immediately then, the door shut locked right behind him and faded away, he was now in an endless and empty black void. The light drew towards them and uttered, "Hello, who are you?" "I don't know who I am. Who are you?" he said. "Oh don't worry, I already know who you are so you don't need to worry about that. It is only up to you to know who you really are. As for me? I'm light." it replied. "Why am I here?" he said, confused at what the light had just said.

"What's going on anyway?" he said. "This is a test. A test to see if you are worthy of the gift." replied the light. "What gift?" he asked. The light calmly answered, "You will find out very soon," as it faded away. A door phased in next to them and sent him to a void, one that was white.<br/><br/>

 Suddenly, he found himself falling down. The sound of the air running past him harassed his ears and yet sounded just as calm. His nerves racked and flickered on and off, he felt a strong force pulling him down, but couldn’t resist it. He screamed, longing for help, but nobody was around. Finally, he accepted fate and what was to happen. The ground ran towards them faster and faster as it went. He closed his eyes and waited. The air stopped screeching, and as he opened his eyes, nothing had happened. He hit the ground, but no pain arrived, no bones had broken. Then he looked up and saw the light come back to him, he had many things to ask. When the light came in, he had his chance.<br/><br/>

"What? How could this happen? How did I not die?" he said. The light sarcastically said, "Oh, there are no real forces here." The light added, "You cannot die here, so don't worry about it." He now had learned something about what was going on around him.<br/><br/>

Suddenly, a pair of eyes flashed onto the two.  "I've got to leave, see you!" said the light as it walked away. A crude growl echoed through, instilling terror into him. The bear kept on growling as it reached him. He swiped the slivers of sweat off of himself and began to run towards the bear. The bear screamed at his face, trying to scare him away but he did not stop. His breath, fast and short, was the only thing the bear could smell. He then stopped and standed tall, staring at the bear. Their eyes locked, still as a boulder. They did not want to look away, and neither were they able to. "You don't scare me at all, not in this world at least." he said, curling up his shivering fists. An eerie noise ringed above the two as they stared, becoming louder every minute. The bear backed away slowly, taking careful steps. The eerie noise fell away as the bear finally ran off.<br/><br/>

Once then, the light faded in and hurried back to him. "Good job, I see now that you are worthy of acquiring the gift." it said. "Okay, what even is it anyway?" he replied. "You'll see when you get it," answered the light. "Follow me now, to where I will give it to you." 

The light then ran off, not awaiting him to come. He now had no choice but to run or stay in the void. Taking a deep breath, he followed the light eagerly. He was alongside the light at first, but the light slowly got faster and quicker than him.<br/><br/>

He kept on running. All what he had gone through he did not want to go to waste. He ran, his breath now quicker than his speed. He tried to continue on running, but he ran short of breath. His feet tumbled down, pulling the rest of the body with it. As he fell on the ground, he felt his body becoming colder and colder with the second. His eyes slowly fell, he tried hard to keep them open but slowly let them go. It was just about to end.<br/><br/>

 Suddenly, he opened his eyes, filled with determination to catch up. He slowly got up, resisting every pull from the ground. He took a deep breath, and started running. His feet raced on, trying to reach the light. Mustering his energy, he ran as fast as he could. His dry mouth tasted like salt and sand, longing for water. The bear he scared away appeared and chased him. It roared, back to eat him. As it got closer, he tried hard to run away but couldn’t. He was barely able to take a step. The eerie noise got louder and louder as the bear ran faster and faster. He fell down, but crawled as fast as he could. It didn't help. The bear was almost about to reach him when...<br/><br/>

Suddenly, James woke up from his bed to find himself in his bedroom. The eerie noise was only an illusion. The dark room around him, supported by the air conditioner that barely worked, was a relief and disappointment at the same time. He turned on his lamp to see if anything was there, finally realising what had happened. Taking a deep breath, he spoke, "I don't know what happened there. Whatever dream or nightmare thing it was, I missed it all. I'm thankful that it wasn't real."
Little did he know.
